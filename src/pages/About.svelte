            ...you have to have a very high IQ to understand <b>{copypastaRickAndMorty}</b>.
            The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of <b>{copypastaTheoreticalPhysics}</b> most of the jokes will go over a typical <b>{copypastaViewer}</b>'s head.
            There's also <b>{copypastaRick}</b>'s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from <b>{copypastaPersonalPhilosophySource}</b>, for instance.
            The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about <b>{copypastaLife}</b>.
            As a consequence people who dislike <b>{copypastaRickAndMorty2}</b> truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in <b>{copypastaRick}</b>'s existential catchphrase "<b>{copypastaCatchphrase}</b>,"
            which itself is a cryptic reference to <b>{copypastaCrypticReference}</b>.
            I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as <b>{copypastaDanHarmon}</b>'s genius wit unfolds itself on their <b>{copypastaTelevisionScreens}</b>.
            What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚
        </p>
        <p>
            And yes, by the way, i DO have a <b>{copypastaRickAndMorty2}</b> tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.
            It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
